Here is an analysis of the generated mazes for the various algorithms.

## Time consumtion
To analyse the time consumtion to generate the maze was done by creating 1 000 random mazes for each method and eache maze size.

Time took to create maze depends of their size and of the algorithm as we can se on the figure below:

## Maze structure analysis
Distribution of nodes with one (dead end), two, three and four connections. The test was done by creating 1 000 random mazes for each method and eache maze size.
