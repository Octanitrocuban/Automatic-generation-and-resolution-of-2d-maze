Here is an analysis of the generated mazes for the various algorithms.

Distribution of nodes with one (dead end), two, three and four connections. The test was done by creating 1 000 random mazes for each method and eache maze size.

## Time consumtion
Time took to create maze depends of their size and of the algorithm as we can se on the figure below:
